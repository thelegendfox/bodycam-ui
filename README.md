# Legendfox R5 Bodycam UI
A simple and customizable bodycam UI inspired by the Axon Body Cam™ using AutoHotkey.

## Installation
First, install AutoHotkey v1.1 from https://www.autohotkey.com/. Then, download the files by clicking the green `<> Code ↓` button and then clicking the "Download ZIP" option. Simply unzip it in your directory of choice! Then, change the config (see below for how) and open `Bodycam.ahk`.

## Usage
Hit your clipping key to start the bodycam. Hit Ctrl+F1 to close it, and F12 to reset it (useful when moving the UI around in the config). **This is intended to REPLACE your clipping and recording keys,** so please don't report any bugs that occur if you hit either while the bodycam is in "Record" mode.

## Config
To change your bodycam settings, open `Config.ahk` in a standard text editor/IDE such as Notepad++ or VSCode. Follow the instructions in there and then simply open `Bodycam.ahk`.
